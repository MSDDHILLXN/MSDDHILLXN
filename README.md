Hey there! I'm Mandeep Singh Dhillon, a data analyst with a knack for turning raw data into meaningful stories. With experience across Python, SQL, and tools like Azure and Power BI, I’m all about building automated pipelines and creating insights that drive smart decisions. Recently, I’ve been diving into AI and cloud infrastructure, with a focus on Oracle Cloud.

Beyond tech, I’m a team player who’s helped run events for thousands, blending my love for data with my passion for teamwork. Always open to connecting over data, tech, or just interesting ideas—let’s chat!
